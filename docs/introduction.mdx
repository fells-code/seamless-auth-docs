# What is SeamlessAuth?

SeamlessAuth is an **exclusively passwordless managed authentication platform** built for developers who want to ship secure, modern authentication without managing identity infrastructure. It provides per-tenant or hybrid-tenant deployment options — each customer receives isolated, production-grade infrastructure.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional authentication systems are complex, insecure, and developer-unfriendly. Frameworks like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect require redirects, callback URLs, and sensitive credential handling. Passwords introduce vulnerability vectors such as credential reuse, phishing, and brute-force attacks. Managing users, sessions, and secure tokens adds operational overhead and compliance risk.

Existing platforms (Auth0, Supabase Auth, FusionAuth, and Stytch) offer convenient APIs, but they often require shared multi-tenant environments, impose branding or UI restrictions, and lock you into their redirect-based flows. These constraints can limit user experience and compliance flexibility.

## The SeamlessAuth Solution

SeamlessAuth removes passwords, redirects, and third-party dependencies entirely. It’s a **managed, drop-in authentication system** that integrates directly into your application — frontend and backend — through our SDKs. You get all the benefits of a managed identity platform with the security, isolation, and control of a self-hosted solution.

- **Exclusively passwordless:** Users authenticate with WebAuthn, Passkeys, and secure tokens.
- **No redirects or iframes:** Authentication happens entirely within your app via secure cookies and public-key challenge flows.
- **Single-tenant isolation:** Each customer’s data and identity logic run in dedicated infrastructure.
- **Compliance-friendly:** SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR alignment are achievable due to isolated environments.
- **Developer-first:** Integrate in minutes using React or Next.js SDKs and Terraform automation.

## How SeamlessAuth Compares

SeamlessAuth combines the control of self-hosted authentication with the simplicity of a managed SaaS. It’s perfect for organizations that need secure, isolated infrastructure without sacrificing speed or usability.

## Technology Behind SeamlessAuth

SeamlessAuth is powered by modern web authentication standards and secure-by-design infrastructure.

### WebAuthn

The **Web Authentication API (WebAuthn)** allows users to authenticate using device-based credentials — like biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID) or hardware security keys. SeamlessAuth manages credential registration, verification, and public key storage automatically.

### Passkeys

**Passkeys** are FIDO2-compliant credentials synced securely across devices. They eliminate passwords entirely while improving usability. SeamlessAuth’s SDKs provide direct Passkey integration for browser and mobile environments.

### Secure Cookies & JWKS

Session management uses **HTTP-only, same-site cookies** for short-lived access and **JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)** for verifiable tokens. This allows your app to validate users without redirecting to an external provider.

### Infrastructure-as-Code

Every SeamlessAuth deployment is powered by **Terraform** and **AWS ECS**. Clients receive their own API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, and database — provisioned automatically from the SeamlessAuth dashboard or API.

### SDK Integration

- **React SDK:** Drop-in `AuthProvider` for instant auth context and session handling.
- **NodeJS Server SDK:** Seamlessly manage cookies and tokens on your own server.
